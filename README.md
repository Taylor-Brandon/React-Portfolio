## Installation
This project can be accessed via the live demo link or locally by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install.
3. Start the application by running npm run start in your terminal.

## Usage
When the portfolio is rendered, users can navigate through the website using the navigation links by clicking the menu icon in the top right corner. This allows them to scroll through the various sections of the site.

Upon the initial render, users can click a link to navigate directly to the information section to learn more about me. As they continue to scroll, they will encounter a gallery showcasing images of past projects. Each image is a clickable link that redirects users to the corresponding project, allowing for further exploration.

Further down, users will find a downloadable resume and a contact form to reach out to me with any inquiries or feedback. Finally, the footer provides links to my GitHub, email, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles.
