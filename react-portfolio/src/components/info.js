            <p id='intro-par'>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. My name is Taylor Brandon, and for nearly two years, I've been dedicated to mastering full-stack development. My journey began with an eagerness to learn and quickly adapt, leading me to work on diverse projectsâ€”from personal endeavors and team activities in Columbia University's boot camp to developing a professional database for a business I'm passionate about.
During this time, I've discovered a deep commitment to innovation, creating user-friendly applications, and a newfound love for problem-solving. I've also developed a profound appreciation for technology and its constant evolution, and I'm driven to connect with and learn from others.
This portfolio reflects my dedication and proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web APIs, server-side APIs, Node.js, OOP, Express, SQL, ORM, MVC, Regex, Mongoose, PWA, React, and MERN applications. I invite you to explore my work and welcome any feedback or inquiries.
